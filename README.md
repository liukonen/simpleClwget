# About
Windows nativly does not have a file downloader application from command line. This means you need to click on a link and let your browser download the file for you. And in odd cases, where you are trying to download certain files, the browser will attempt to rendor the file rather then just download the object. Linux (at the time I first wrote this, I had Mandrake, which turned to Mandriva Linux) had get, and I fell in love with it. I wished windows had a similar option, which it didn't. So my goal was to copy the same type of functionality to windows
